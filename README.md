# Neuralnet

Required 
python = 2.7
numpy

It is a single layer Simple perception neural network which shows how we train neural network .
It contains input for network in the program stored as a list. Then neural network is trained. This script displays how threshold value of 
neuron changes with training. 

# About Perceptron

It was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt. It was the first learning model capable of working as binary classifier.
Initially, it was intended to be a machine rather than a program and was used in IBM 704 for image recognition.
Mathematical Model:

f(x) = 

       1 if w*x + b> 0

       0 otherwise
